    "# Generative Downscaling of Atmospheric Data using CorrDiff\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook demonstrates how to use Modulus's [CorrDiff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15214)\n",
    "implementation. Similar to diagnostic models, CorrDiff does not predict a future weather state. Instead\n",
    "a diagnostic set of variables can be derived at a finer resolution than the original atmospheric data.\n",
    "In this case we will super-resolve data over Taiwan from a 25km to 2km resolution.\n",
    "CorrDiff produces an ensemble of high-resolution realisations, accounting for the stochastic\n",
    "nature of small-scale structures. The ensemble output will then be loaded into an xarray Dataset\n",
    "and some sample data plotting is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary this notebook will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configuring and setting up CorrDiff\n",
    "- Produce a downscaled ensemble through various realisations of stochastic features\n",
    "- Plot result and compare different realisations of ensemble\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set Up and Execute Downscaling\n",
    "As always, we're starting off with some imports of libraries and the generate method from\n",
    "CorrDiff. CorrDiff is currently not implemented in E2MIP, we will hence leverage the Modulus\n",
    "implementation. The config file is located under `/e2ws/exercises/corrdiff/conf`.\n",
    "Note that the hydra package, which reads the config, only accepts relative paths to the file. In the\n",
    "case of running a notebook in a container, the path has to be defined relative to the location at\n",
    "which the jupyter server was launched. This notebook assumes that jupyter was launchef in `/e2ws`, if\n",
    "you launched it from a different location you have to edit the `config_path` in the `hydra.initialize`\n",
    "call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, the generate method will load snapshots at times specified in\n",
    "the config file. The default values select three snapshots on 12 September 2021,\n",
    "when Typhoon Chanthu passed over Taiwan. Chanthu was the second most intense TC in 2021\n",
    "The coarse data stems from the ERA5 data set and has a resolution of 25km. Firstly, the regression\n",
    "model is applied predicting the _ensemble mean_ of the downscaled variables at a resolution\n",
    "of 2km. In a second step, the diffusion model restores the fine structures, which are not resolved\n",
    "by the original data. With respect to the coarse resolution, these structures have stochastic nature.\n",
    "The diffusion model can therefore predict a range of realisations of these structures, producing an\n",
    "ensemble."
